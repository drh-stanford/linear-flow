Description: Flow is a *Format*-neutral, *Language*-agnostic, *Open*-source *Workflow* tool
        -- a veritible Swiss-army knife for scientific workflow integration,
        automation, execution, and reporting. Flow cares not about which data formats
        or software tools you use. Flow cares only about running workflows with
        minimal integration effort. Flow uses a database of workflow *styles* and a
        simple linear process model to automate execution for a myrid of different
        scientific workflow styles. For example, a 'simple' style uses the following
        process model: Setup, Import, Ingest, Model, Digest, Export, and Finish.
